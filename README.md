# Deloitte Australia-Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage.

## What I did
- Cleaned and validated datasets using advanced Excel
- Used conditional logic (ABS, IF, nested formulas) to classify equality gaps (Fair / Unfair / Highly Discriminative)
- Analyzed downtime patterns across factories and device types
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate findings clearly
