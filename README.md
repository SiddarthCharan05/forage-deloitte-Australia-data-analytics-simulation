# Deloitte Australia-Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage.

## What I did
- Cleaned and validated datasets using advanced Excel
- Used conditional logic (ABS, IF, nested formulas) to classify equality gaps (Fair / Unfair / Highly Discriminative)
- Analyzed downtime patterns across factories and device types
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate findings clearly

## Repository structure
- `data/` → Excel files used for analysis
- `images/` → Tableau dashboard screenshots
- `docs/` → Certificate (optional)
- `tableau/` → Tableau workbook (optional)

## Tools
- Excel (advanced formulas, validation, classification)
- Tableau (dashboards, insight communication)
